We are a Canadian/Swedish family of four—Gwen, Anders & our 2 boys—who live in Gothenburg, Sweden.
In April 2016, after 18 months in the real-estate arena, we chose to move from a rental house to a one-bedroom apartment nearer the city centre. While our decision was unconventional with two small children, we reasoned that living small could suit our needs. We made a 5-year-plan and hoped it would work out. 

6 years later, we’re still living and growing in our 480 ft<sup>2</sup> (54 m<sup>2</sup>) Palace. While we knew initially that this decision would bring challenges and baffle some, we were unprepared for the freedom and creativity the choice would afford us -- or how the limitations of our family quarters would transform into a platform of possibility.
